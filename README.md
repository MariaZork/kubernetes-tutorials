# Kubernetes tutorials

This repository contains tutorials to help get started with Kubernetes.

1. **hello-world**: this tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a simple web application using FastAPI on Kubernetes. The application consists of a single container running a Python web server that responds to HTTP requests with a "Hello, World!" message.

2. **iris-model**: this tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a simple machine learning model for iris flower classification on Kubernetes. Model responds to HTTP POST reguests and returns prediction label.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster running, and the 'kubect' command-line tool installed and configured to communicate with your cluster. You can set up a cluster using a cloud provider (such as Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure), or by setting up a local cluster on your machine using a tool like Minikube.
You will also need to have Docker installed to build the Docker images used in these examples.
